# public_mobile_call_history
makes an excel file of all your cellphone usage to see how much you used your phone

Public Mobile doesn't let you see your call usage for some reason but only give you a huge log of all your calls, text messages, and data usage events but with no summary.
This program goes through the log supplied on their website and converts it into an excel sheet and saves it onto your computer

The first page of the excel document outputs a summary of the month time period specified breaking it up into incoming and outgoing call duration, data usage, incoming and outgoing sms text messages and the number of MMS messages. The rest of the sheets on the excel page are the logs scraped from the public mobile web site.
